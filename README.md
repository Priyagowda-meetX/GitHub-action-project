# GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline Documentation
# 1. Introduction
This document explains the setup, workflow, and functioning of a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for deploying containerized applications to AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service).
# The process involves:
# Continuous Integration (CI): Building, testing, and preparing the application.
# Continuous Deployment (CD): Pushing Docker images to AWS ECR and updating ECS tasks automatically after a pull request (PR) is merged.
